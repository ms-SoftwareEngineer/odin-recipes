    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Mango lassi is a popular beverage in India and other parts of the world. 
        It is a sweet and creamy drink that is perfect for quenching your thirst 
        on a hot day. The drink is made by blending ripe mangoes with yogurt, 
        milk, and sugar. The result is a smooth and frothy drink that is perfect 
        for sipping.

    <p>
        Mango lassi is not only delicious, but it is also healthy. 
        The drink is rich in vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin C 
        and potassium. Yogurt, which is one of the main ingredients in mango 
        lassi, is a great source of protein and calcium, making it a healthy 
        and filling drink.
